## Board Game Filter Project

This repository serves as the base for the GitHub Page that lists out all of my board games, and have interactive filters to select any games that are applicable to the number of players, length of play time, and complexity.

Future upgrades: 
- Improvements to formatting (make it more visually appealing)
- Add functionality to filter by tag (likely create button for each one)
- Add ability to utilize multiple filters at once (currently only filters based on most recently used filter)
- Could have link to instructions / pictures / etc when you click on the game
- Could say how much room it takes up, ie. needs table, needs large table, anywhere?
- Create another page for Wishlist - maybe link to it from this page
